# a
A is my text editor. 

- Closely resembles an incomplete version of Acme or Sam.
- Supports editing binary files. 
  `The underlying frame implementation (see as/frame) does not eschew null bytes, so it has its uses for file carving and forensic analysis. UTF-8 is not implemented at this time, but this is an easy endeavor.`
- Standard UNIX keyboard shortcuts
  `No crazy vi/emacs shenanigans`
- Command Language
  `Edit command language is 80% implemented (slow)`
